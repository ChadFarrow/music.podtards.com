# Podtardstr Music Project Status Board

---

## ⚠️ PROJECT DEPRECATED - JULY 20, 2025

### **Current Status**
- **Status:** 🔴 DEPRECATED - Code split approach abandoned
- **Replacement:** Using main podtardstr repository for music.podtards.com
- **Production URL:** https://music.podtards.com (now deployed from main repo)
- **Active Repo:** https://github.com/ChadFarrow/podtardstr
- **Current Version:** 1.267 (in main repo)

### **Migration Summary**
This separate music repository was abandoned in favor of using the main `podtardstr` repository with minimal changes:
- Homepage route changed from Index (Top 100) to Albums
- Site title updated for music focus
- All album functionality preserved
- Single repository approach much more maintainable

### **Why This Approach Was Abandoned**
- Code splitting by Cursor didn't work properly
- Separate repositories created maintenance overhead  
- Missing dependencies and configuration issues
- Complex build process for simple changes
- Main repository already had all needed functionality

### **Final Solution**
✅ **Used main podtardstr repository** with minimal changes
✅ **Deployed to music.podtards.com** successfully  
✅ **All features preserved** - albums, player, payments, theming
✅ **Vercel project** connected to github.com/ChadFarrow/podtardstr
✅ **Domain configured** and DNS propagated
✅ **Both sites operational** - app.podtards.com (full) and music.podtards.com (music-only)
✅ **Dead code removed** - cleaned up unused Top 100 chart and non-music components  

### **Lessons Learned**
- **Minimal changes > complex splits**: Simple route change worked better than full code separation
- **Single repository approach**: Easier maintenance and deployment  
- **Use existing working code**: Don't rebuild what already works
- **Simple is better**: Over-engineering creates more problems than it solves
- **Dead code removal**: Periodic cleanup improves performance and maintainability
- **Focused user experience**: Music-only navigation provides cleaner UX

## 🚮 **THIS PROJECT IS DEPRECATED**

**Use the main repository instead:**
- **Repository**: https://github.com/ChadFarrow/podtardstr  
- **Live Site**: https://music.podtards.com
- **Documentation**: See Build_log.md in main repository

This folder and repository can be safely deleted.

### **Important Implementation Details**
- **Component Architecture:** Modular design with single-responsibility components
- **Payment Flow:** V4VPaymentButton component handles all Lightning interactions
- **Audio State:** usePodcastPlayer hook with Zustand for global state
- **Album Playback:** useAlbumFeed hook for RSS feed parsing and track management
- **Color Extraction:** useColorExtraction hook for dynamic album artwork theming
- **TLV Records:** Use 7629169 for Podcast Index 2.0 compliance with all required fields
- **Loading Prevention:** Track loading states to prevent rapid-click conflicts
- **Mobile PWA:** Service worker, manifest, proper viewport settings prevent zoom issues

### **File Structure Notes**
- **Components:** Modular design with single-responsibility components
  - `AlbumGallery.tsx` - Main albums grid with responsive layout
  - `AlbumViewEnhanced.tsx` - Individual album page with immersive design
  - `AlbumBackground.tsx` - Dynamic background styling and overlay
  - `AlbumHero.tsx` - Album art display and details section
  - `TrackList.tsx` - Track listing with controls and payment buttons
  - `AlbumRecommendations.tsx` - PodRoll and static album recommendations
  - `AlbumControls.tsx` - Custom hook for album playback logic
  - `PodcastPlayer.tsx` - Audio player with queue management
  - `V4VPaymentButton.tsx` - Payment logic and boost modal
- **Custom Hooks:** Separated business logic from UI components
  - `useAlbumFeed.ts` - RSS feed parsing and album data management
  - `usePodcastPlayer.ts` - Global audio player state management
  - `useColorExtraction.ts` - Album artwork color extraction and theming
- **Payment Utils:** `src/lib/payment-utils.ts` handles all Lightning payment logic
- **Feed Parser:** `src/lib/feed-parser.ts` for RSS feed parsing and V4V data extraction
- **Theme Context:** `src/contexts/ThemeContext.tsx` for theme management

### **Testing & Build Status**
- **Tests:** Configured with Vitest ✅
- **Build:** Successful production build ✅
- **Deployment:** Auto-deploy on push to main ✅
- **PWA:** Installable with proper manifest and service worker ✅

### **Common Issues & Solutions (Quick Reference)**
- **Album play buttons not working:** FIXED - Use onMouseDown instead of onClick, ensure z-index < 50
- **Audio fetch abort errors:** FIXED - Simplified audio loading, let browser handle timing naturally  
- **Track switching not working:** FIXED - Use podcast ID comparison instead of URL comparison
- **Play buttons showing through bottom player:** FIXED - Reduced z-index from 999 to 10
- **Double-click required:** Check loadingTrackId state in usePodcastPlayer hook
- **Bottom player not visible:** Ensure fixed positioning with z-50 in PodcastPlayer.tsx
- **Mobile zoom issues:** Check viewport meta tag has minimum-scale=1.0
- **V4V payments failing:** Check TLV metadata format matches Podcast Index 2.0 spec
- **Loading states stuck:** Ensure setTimeout clears loadingTrackId after 1000ms
- **Component coupling issues:** REFACTORED - Separated concerns into focused components/hooks

### **Key Commands**
- **Development:** `npm run dev`
- **Build:** `npm run build` 
- **Test:** `npm test`
- **Lint:** `npm run lint`
- **Push & Deploy:** `git add . && git commit -m "message" && git push`
